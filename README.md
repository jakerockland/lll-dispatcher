## lll-dispatcher

This repository contains an Ethereum smart contract function dispatcher and an associated example contract, both written in LLL, Ethereum's Low-level Lisp-like Language. Its purpose is to show that LLL is a viable language in which to write smart contracts and that doing so is not as difficult as one might assume.

I've written a [series of articles](http://blog.syrinx.net/the-resurrection-of-lll-part-1/) on the subject where I go into great detail describing the code and my motivations for suggesting LLL as an alternative smart contract development language.

The original LLL documentation was removed from the Wiki a while back, but it can still be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/LLL-PoC-6/04fae9e627ac84d771faddcf60098ad09230ab58).
